Welcome to our GitHub repository! Here's a guide to help you navigate the contents:

**OriginalCode&Translation**: This directory contains the modified version of the original code, adapted to produce consistent results with the same seed across both C# and C++ platforms. Please note that this version differs slightly from the one used in our tests, as it employs a file-based approach to verify result consistency between the two languages.

**PDGwBK**: Here, you'll find all the code and tests related to the paper. This section includes detailed instructions on how to set up and run the project, along with the methodology for conducting the tests presented in our research.

We hope you find this repository useful. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please feel free to reach out.

Have a great day!
